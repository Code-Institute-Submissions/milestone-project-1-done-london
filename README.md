### Design

* Colour Scheme

    * The main colours used are black (#000000) and white (#ffffff) to keep the styling in line with the brand logo. As with similar sites, colours are kept to a minimum in order to put the focus on the products on offer. Red (#b71c1c) has been used to highlight buttons and links in order to draw attention to them. A darker red (#7f0000) has been used to accent buttons when hovered over to provied a point of difference and positive UX.
    
* Typography

    * P22 Johnston Underground is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case the font isn't being imported into the site correctly for any reason. P22 Johnston Underground was chosen as it is the font used in the Done London logo.
    * Roboto is used as the secondary font as it is a clean, attractive font used frequently in programming that pairs well with the main font and provides a subtle point of difference to the typography of the website.

* Imagery

    * The imagery used is from a recent photo shoot and has been chosen to promote the brand and draws on the link with Transport for London (TfL) from their recent collaboration. All photos were taken by [Ryan O'Toole Collett](https://www.ryanotoolecollett.com/).

* Wireframes

    * [Home Page Wireframe](https://github.com/theopmw/milestone-project-1-done-london/blob/master/assets/wireframes/home_wireframe.pdf)
    * [Shop Page Wireframe](https://github.com/theopmw/milestone-project-1-done-london/blob/master/assets/wireframes/shop_wireframe.pdf)
    * [About Page Wireframe](https://github.com/theopmw/milestone-project-1-done-london/blob/master/assets/wireframes/about_wireframe.pdf)

## Features

Each page features a responsive **navigation bar** with conventional placing of the **logo** (top left) and navigation links (top right). The navigation links reduce to a toggle menu at mobile size to improve UX and provide positive responsive design.
Each page has a responsive **footer** with **join mailing list**, **copyright information** and **social media icons** linking to the brands social media pages. The join mailing list feature was removed on small and medium screen sizes so as not to clutter the UI.

#### Home

The Home page features a **hero image carousel** with navigation functionality displaying three images of models wearing the brands products. On mobile and tablet there are a set of three portrait images to better suit the screen size at these breakpoints, this is changed to landscape at the desktop size.
There is a **call to action button** overalyed towards the bottom of the carousel to encourage visitors to **"Shop Now"** by guiding them to the **Shop page** to further explore the product range and direct them towards making a purchase.
The purpose of this hero carousel element is to give maximum impact when arriving at the website and drive visitors towards the shop page.

#### Shop

The Shop page features a **hero image** followed by a **shop heading** styled in a similar style to the navigation bar and inkeeping with the overall style and presentation of the website. 
Below this are images of the range of products on offer. Each image is a link to the product page which will have a more detailed product description and information about sizing, ordering etc. (this functionality is beyond the scope of this project but is a feature that will be added at a later date - see "Features to Implement in Future" section below).
Below the product image is a brief description of the product and below that is the price. Under the product image is an **"Add to basket"** button which will add the item to the users basket (this functionality is beyond the scope of this project but is a feature that will be added at a later date - see "Features to Implement in Future" section below). It currently links to the basket page which features a "coming soon" message as basket funtionality is beyond the scope of this project.
The Shop page is layed out in columns of **Bootstrap cards** with an image, supporting text, pricing and an "Add to basket" button, 2 columns wide for mobile devices and 4 columns wide for tablet and desktop.
This design choice was made to give each individual product enough space to be viewed clearly by the visitor without overcrowding the UI or making links or buttons hard to press on mobile devices.

#### About

The About page features a **hero image** followed by an **about heading** and is broken up into two sections with relevant **sub-headings**.
First, the **"who we are"** section containing a brief **paragraph** explaining the brand history, ethos and who it has collaborated with in the past. This was taken from an article on [The Industry.Fashion](https://www.theindustry.fashion/done-london-launches-tfl-collection-nsew/) website. It has been kept breif in order to satisfy curiosity without overwhelming the user.
Below this is a short **promotional video** that engages the user and shows them more about where the brand takes its inspiration from.
Second, the **"press"** section contains **Bootstrap cards** with **thumbnail images and text** of recent press articles written about the brand. These contain an image of the sources logo, the headline and the first sentence, to give the viewer a idea of what the article is about. Below this is a **"See more >>"** button which will open the full article in a new tab. These behave responsively with the images displayed above the text on mobile and to the left of the text on tablet and desktop.

#### Contact

The Contact page features a **hero image** followed by a **contact heading** and is broken up into four **sub-headings** detailing the various ways to contact the company and a button to launch a modal which users can click to sign up to the mailing list.
First, the **visit us in store** section provides the user with the **shop address**, a **Google Maps image** of the shops location and **two images of the shop interior**. On mobile devices, only the map is visible to provide a positive responsive design.
Second, the **send us an email** section provides the user with the two email addresses for the business. One for shop enquiries and one for print enquiries. The email addresses are links to open up the users default mail app to assist in guiding them to make contact and are highlighted in red to grab attention.
Third, the **send us a message** section features a **contact form**, which requests the users name, email, and a box to add their message. At the bottom of the form is a **Send Button**. The width of the form changes depending on the screen size to ensure it looks clear on all devices. The form is not currently functional as it is beyond the scope of this project (see "Features to Implement in Future" section below).
Finally, the **join our mailing list** section features a **paragraph element** explaining what users gain from signing up to the mailing list and a **Join Mailing List Button** that launches a **Modal** which requests the clients name and email. Below this is a **Close Button** to close the modal and a **Submit** button to submit the request. The submit button is not currently functional as it is beyond the scope of this project (see "Features to Implement in Future" section below).

#### Basket

The Basket page features a message that the page is under construction and invites users to come back soon once basket funtionality had been added to the site.
